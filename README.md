# COVID19 Information spreading

Life Data Epidemiology project, a.y. 2020/2021

In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines seem to be the best option for slowing down
disease spreading. In this work, we want to understand the role of vaccine information spreading
withing this framework. To do that, we start from a model that describes a SIR-SIRV dynamics for
information and disease transmission on a multiplex network. As result, we find that there exists
an optimal information transmission rate that slows down the spreading of the disease, increasing
the number of individuals that get vaccinated. Then, we implement a variation of this model that
takes into account demographic and epidemiological features relevant for COVID-19 disease. It
consists in a SIR-SIARV age-based model that considers two age groups of individuals and the
role of asymptomatic individuals. For this new model, we find again the existence of an optimal
information transmission rate. This result can be employed in policy making, to tune the information
diffusion to get the higher possible number of immunized individuals.
